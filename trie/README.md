Trie
====

The trie data structure is an array of arrays, pretty similar to `r_db`, but
limited to printable strings. This data structure can be useful to define
all the commands and subcommands in r2.

As long as it's not used in r2 yet it has been moved here, for further
testing and comparison with other k=v data structures and expose them when
required making them available from Sdb or an SdbExtras library.
